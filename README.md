Similar to the board game of Candy Land, our game will implement a board with certain cards detailing actions. However, a dice will be used to roll (with animation) and the theme will be coffee, a pun on Java. Trivia questions will occur when the player lands on certain squares about Java (coding language) and coffee (from the island of Java).
